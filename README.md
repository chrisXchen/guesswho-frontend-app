# guesswho-frontend-app

###### a game where you have to talk to a mystery character to try and get information about who they are (for it to be fun, don't just ask their name!).

### Short term goals (FROM A BIRDS EYE)

- [x] get chat feature working in the same way, however chat messages are only stored on the brwoser in the react states (if they reload the page then they lose their previous messages)
- [ ] refactor backend (easy)
- [ ] add tests for backend routes (medium)
- [x] refactor frontend, this means finally making components and pages (hard)

### Medium term goals (features I want to get out soon)

- [ ] add share via socials button 
- [ ] add stats for each user like in wordle
- [ ] add contact forms in case a user wants characters/series or features added

### Long term goals

- [ ] keep game on home page ("/" - root url) but add button to take user to custom ("/customize")
- [ ] on custom, take them through a start process of
    - select television show, book series, movie series, or manually type in characters and add them to list
    - select how many chat messages and guesses they'll get
    - start
