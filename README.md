TODAYS GOALS FROM A BIRDS EYE
COMPLETED - get chat feature working in the same way, however chat messages are only stored on the brwoser in the react states (if they reload the page then they lose their previous messages)
- unnecessary for tomorrow but nice:
    - refactor backend (easy)
    - add tests for backend routes (medium)
    - refactor frontend, this means finally making components and pages (hard)
